This is not parsed by the program in anyway, just put sentences or words that Tito Derek would say and I'll add them.
(If there are a lot I'll start using automation. Machine Learning automation so no errors yay!)

Examples:

Ang [insultingAdjective] naman.
These [insultingNoun] yeah?

A randomized word is put where the [] are.



List Starts Here:

	Insulting Adjectives:
		nuts
		stupid
		dumb
		
	Insulting Nouns:
		genius
		idiot
		moron
		
	Dog Names:
		Shobee
		Oliviot

	Sentences:
		//Expressed in JavaScript
		r = "Ang " + word(insultingAdjectives) + " naman.";
		r = "These " + s + suffix(word(insultingNouns)) + " yeah?";
		r = "I know " + random(100) + " forms of martial arts.";
		r = "Ang " + word(insultingAdjectives) + " naman si " + word(dogNames) + "!";
		
	Other Sentences: //Specific sentences that are too complex to be expressed with code. (Well atleast my code)
		You are all idiots.
